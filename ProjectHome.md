The goal of git-php is a robust PHP web interface to git repositories. It is meant to be easily customizable through styles and the ability to be embedded into any PHP page. For example, creating a git repository viewer plug-in for your favorite PHP based cms should be easy with git-php.

The main repository is here:

http://zackb.org/git-php/index.php?p=git-php.git

to clone with git:
> git clone http://zackb.org/git/git-php.git
